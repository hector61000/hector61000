👁️‍🗨️ OMAR ZAKARIA | SYSTEM BREACHER | CODE TERRORIST
🧠 WHO AM I?
"I don't fit into systems.
I break them and build my own."

I'm not a programmer.
I'm a digital insurgent, a one-man cyber army.
I speak C like it’s my native bloodline,
and I turn complexity into devastation.

In my world:

🔥 Rules are meant to be bypassed.

🧠 Limits are nothing but illusions.

🛡️ Every byte has a purpose: domination.

⚔️ TECH ARSENAL
C Language — Writing memory-optimized, death-proof programs.

Linux Systems — Living and breathing shell environments.

Reverse Engineering — Digging into binaries like a surgeon.

Networking — Mastering sockets, protocols, and packet warfare.

Exploit Development — Turning vulnerabilities into opportunities.

Python/Bash — Rapid fire scripting when speed matters.

🎯 PHILOSOPHY
"If it bleeds, it can be hacked."

I don't write apps.
I craft resilient infrastructures.
I don't design websites.
I build weapons that never sleep.

Speed. Stability. Anonymity.
That's my holy trinity.
