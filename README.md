🧠 About Me
"I don't write code.
I build weapons."

I'm a Full-Stack Engineer wired differently.
C language is my mother tongue.
I create systems that don't crash, don't slow down, and don't break under pressure.

I'm not just a developer —
I'm a system breaker, problem sniper, and performance junkie.
My world is made of bytes, exploits, and clean architectures.

⚡ Skill Arsenal
🛡 C & C++ Development — Building low-level beasts.

🧠 Reverse Engineering — Understanding software inside-out.

🔥 Performance Optimization — Speed is not optional.

⚔ API Engineering — Crafting high-velocity backends.

🕵️‍♂️ Security First — Code it. Fortify it. Defend it.

🔥 Code Philosophy
"If your code can't survive a DDoS,
if it can't handle a million requests,
if it can't recover from failure —
it's not worthy."

Every function I write is built for chaos.
Every system I design is ready for war.
